# floral-recipes

A commission for a wedding & events planner.

An internal app to make floral orders intended to reduce human error. Features an editable database of flowers, and the ability to create and edit event projects. The user can fill the projects by creating arrangements of flowers from the database. The app will calculate how many flowers to order based on the contents and quantities of floral arrangements. The total of flowers as well as the total costs update dynamically, allowing the user to play around with data and be creative as they design their events within a budget.
